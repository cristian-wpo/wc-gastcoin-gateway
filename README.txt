== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q: What is blockchain? =
A: A blockchain is a public database. In the context of cryptocurrencies, this database is used to manage money transactions. The term "chain" comes from the chain to which transactions are added in chronological order. New blocks are created according to a consensus procedure and attached to an existing chain using cryptographic procedures.

= Q: What is Binance Smart Chain? =
A: Just add your *Payment details* on your [account dashboard](https://gastcoin.com/) to remove the limit.

= Q: What is BEP-20? =
A: BEP-20 is a token standard on Binance Smart Chain that extends ERC-20, the most common Ethereum token standard. You can think of it as a blueprint for tokens that defines how they can be spent, who can spend them, and other rules for their usage. Due to its similarity to Binance Chain’s BEP-2 and Ethereum’s ERC-20, it’s compatible with both.

= Q: What is BscScan? =
A: Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is Binance's high-performance blockchain, which provides a platform for decentralized applications. Binance launched Binance Smart Chain to provide a fast and affordable alternative for the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) market, which has suffered from Ethereum's (gas) high transaction fees. It was born in September 2020 and has a five-second Time Blocking with a proof-of-authority-based consensus mechanism to ensure scalability.

= Q: What is Metamask? =
A: BEP-20 is the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) protocol. Compared to the Ethereum network protocol (ERC-20), it has much faster execution times (5 to 15 seconds) and much lower transaction costs (gas).

= Q: Which browsers support Metamask and Trust Wallet? =
A: Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Brave.

= Q: What is a token? =
A: A token is a digital asset that differs from a cryptocurrency in that it does not have its own blockchain. Therefore, the vast majority of so-called "cryptocurrencies" are actually tokens based on the blockchain of cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ERC-20) or Binance (BSC-20).
